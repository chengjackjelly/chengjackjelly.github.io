# How is my early game progress and Why/Where do I feel stuck.

I have played 20 h so far and have started many many saves. I think it is time to actually reflect on this game seriously! This save I discussed in this article is around 50 cycles, which is by far the longest cycles I had. 

## Background and Problems

The reason this save I go much farther than previous run could be
- I am lucky. Two of my dups are resisted to food poison.
- I become less afraid of polluted water/oxygen by learning how to deal with it in a really basic way.
- Be sensitive to moral improvement at the very first beginning so none of my dup is stressed at this point.

However, there still a handful of things I do not understand at this point. So far I don't know how soon they're going to cause a real problem. So let's find out!

### Food

I currently have used refrigerator. However, most of my food still carried gems. My main food source is meal lice. I keep track of a dup when they harvest meal lice and found out they need to pass by the toilet every time they save something to the refrigerator. And sometime a dup just enter the polluted area will go and pick up meal lice to refrigerator also. So a big problem here is I do not have any strategy at the moment for dup to remove gem before/enter the polluted area. So here we need to find out where does dup carried those gem from. Because they are (food poison gem in yellow), but currently the polluted area is all slime, which should be in green. but other area besides bathroom does not have any surface gem as i saw. one thing could be those polluted dirt that is randomly spread in the road. I currently also do not have any strategy in isolating them, e.g in a separated box that is placed in a environment that kill gem gradually for instance.


### Water

My current way at the beginning is to find a tank of water, use them first. At the moment it is quite close to run out. I have a bigger tank further down, but it is not clear to me how to arrange the pipe. I have not used water sieve also, and to use it, i also need to consider how to deal with polluted dirt. some critters like pokeshells can eat polluted dirt and create sand which is really sustainable. but i have not yet capture any of those.

Also my current main food source required a lot of water. This can be changed by switch to other food, like berry sludge, but now i have not yet discover any sleet wheat. 

### Gas transmission

I think the goal here is to move unbreathable air to somewhere and seperate them use gas filter so that it can then be used for purpose like power generation(natural gas) or farming purpose(co2). problem is I am not sure if I should keep it far away from the main base area. and how to handle the growing air pressure.

### Slime area

I am still not sure how to best enter those areas and store slime. 

### Critter

Not explored so far at all. they seem to be essential for sustainability aspect.
