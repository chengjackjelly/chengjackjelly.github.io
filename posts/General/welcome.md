# Welcome to My Blog

This is a minimal blog built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It renders markdown on the client side using [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/).

## Features

- Write posts in **Markdown**
- Organize posts by **categories**
- Include images easily
- No build step required

## Example Image

You can include images from the `images/` folder like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](images/example.jpg)
```

Or from external URLs.

## Code Blocks

Code highlighting works too:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

Enjoy blogging!
