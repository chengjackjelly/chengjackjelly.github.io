### Some reflection while writing thesis

My biggest fear often comes from not being confident enough in my own knowledge. That is probably the biggest reason why I was so focused on the technology part at the beginning. I had a thought stuck in my mind that I was here to solve a technology problem (handling big data), but I wasn’t even that familiar with Snowflake and other big data tools in general. So I spent most of my thesis focusing on it.

The good thing is, I did become familiar with the tool. But I was still not satisfied with the thesis outcome. Why? I would say it is because I failed to discover the real problem that this tool was trying to solve. That requires another set of skills, and not necessarily from using programming tools. I would say it is a mix of both analytical skills (or math in general terms) and communication skills. Of course the domain knowledge will help a lot here, but I believe that is something we built up during communication as a person who have so little experience to the domain in the first place.

Based on this conclusion, I think a systematic study of the math used in this domain is really necessary if one wants to take further steps. Then one can have the confidence to recognize the pros and cons when applying certain algorithms. This becomes a message to convey to the domain experts, who can then, based on these conclusions and their domain expertise, make decisions on how to refine the algorithm.

This is my understanding, and it will also serve as a direction for me to continue this type of work if given the chance. However, I am also not 100% sure if it is going to work and the difficulties behind it.
